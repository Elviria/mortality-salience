# mortality-salience
Mortality salience enhances people’s feelings of guilt but not feelings of shame when recalling personal experiences.

We delineated the neural mechanisms underlying mortality salience’s effect on guilt and shame and demonstrated that mortality salience modulates the self-referential processing of guilt and shame in a different way.

Neural activities during the priming task were partly predictive of the neural activities when participants were recalling guilt and shame events.
